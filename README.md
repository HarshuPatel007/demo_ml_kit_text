# Description
This Flutter application utilizes ML Kit, a machine learning framework by Google, to perform text recognition on images. The app allows users to capture or select a photo containing text and then extracts the text from the image using ML Kit's powerful optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities.

# Key Features:
- Capture or select photos from the device's gallery
- Extract text from images using ML Kit's OCR
- Display the recognized text on the screen
- Support for multiple languages and character sets

By leveraging Flutter's cross-platform capabilities and ML Kit's robust OCR algorithms, this application provides a simple yet powerful tool for extracting text from photos. Whether you need to extract information from documents, receipts, or any other text-containing image, this app offers a convenient and efficient solution.

Please refer to the project's documentation and the ML Kit documentation for more information on how to use the application and customize it to your specific needs.
